# SocketLib
SocketLib is a dynamically linked library written in C to perform socket networking operations with both efficiency, speed, and reliability.
The versatility of C allows this dll (so in unix) to be loaded by any language supporting library loading (C++, C, Python, Java, etc.) and wrapper functions can be writen for ease of use.
Note C and C++ will natively support this library by using the included header file along with the library itself. Other languages may benefit from wrapper functions and classes.
